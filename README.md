# MLB Player Performance Tracker

This web application is for MLB fans interested in keeping up with MLB player performances and stats. It uses the official MLB stats API to display real-time data about MLB players' stats. It is currently a work in progress and I plan to design an algorithm that ranks players based on their baseball statistics on the day.
